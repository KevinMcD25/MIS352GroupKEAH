# MIS352GroupKEAH
This is the MIS 353 Repo for ( Kevin McDonald, Eric Scull, Andrew Taughinbaugh, and Hayden Rhodes

**Project Dsc**

This is an application that is a mix of an adventure WV page and a planning tool for outdoor adventures. We would like to promote going outdoors and seeing what the Appalachia has to offer. One function of the application will be to help outdoor goers plan their trips using our application. They will set a date and the information about that weather season and activities you can do will populate. This application will also provide you with the rich history and views that the Appalacha has to offer!

**Current Phase**

Kevin: We are currently in Phase 1 of our application, we need to develop our first pages

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

**Future Implementation**

Kevin: I would like to start adding more detail to my homepage and find out new types of styles I could use
Hayden: I would like to add the option that forwards mail in the contact us page to an actual email address

**Competitive Analysis**

This site is a great visual image, I feel like one major part of making a good home page would be to make it look good to the eyes. Secondly, I feel like they do a good job and providing you with buttons inviting you to see what the other pages have. When I further inspected the site I noticed that the HTML is very simple. One bootstrap with buttons and href links. they include scripts in their code as well but I have no clue what they do as of now. I noticed they also include footers which might be nice when making my own page.

This site gives weather data similar to what we envision our site to do, but it doesn't give good travel advice for activities.  Also, this website is very clunky to look at.  It seems unorganized.  When inspecting the page, it is mainly run-off javascript, they did not use a bootstrap when designing this website.  Instead, they made the layout of the page on their own.  I would like to implement javascript into our project as it has some cool features that I could utilize.

**Git Hub Research**

(https://github.com/stefanfeldner/capstone-travel-app)

I found a similar GitHub repo to the project that we are doing. This code reaches an API to deliver information about the Destination during the date selection. It would be helpful when coming up with search methods and writing if statements in functions to deliver data to the client. I also like the UI of their application, I might try to replicate it to some degree. Overall, I feel like this GitHub repo will be very helpful in the making of our app.

This GitHub repository is similar to what we want to do.  Though it is a large scale, it can provide a user with the desired locations based on what temperature they input into the API.  I feel like this could have use in our project, but instead of a destination, it would give back a certain time frame to travel the state of West Virginia.  I feel like i might try to implement this API into this project, as it would be easier to use instead of creating my own.
