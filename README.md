# MIS352GroupKEAH
This is the MIS 353 Repo for ( Kevin McDonald, Eric Scull, Andrew Taughinbaugh, and Hayden Rhodes

**Project Dsc**

This is an application that is a mix of an adventure WV page and a planning tool for outdoor adventures. We would like to promote going outdoors and seeing what the Appalachia has to offer. One function of the application will be to help outdoor goers plan their trips using our application. They will set a date and the information about that weather season and activities you can do will populate. This application will also provide you with the rich history and views that the Appalacha has to offer!

**Future Implementation**

Kevin: I would like to start adding more detail to my homepage and find out new types of styles I could use

This site is a great visual image, I feel like one major part of making a good home page would be to make it look good to the eyes. Secondly, I feel like they do a good job and providing you with buttons inviting you to see what the other pages have. When I further inspected the site I noticed that the HTML is very simple. One bootstrap with buttons and href links. they include scripts in their code as well but I have no clue what they do as of now. I noticed they also include footers which might be nice when making my own page.

**Git Hub Research**

I found a similar GitHub repo to the project that we are doing. This code reaches an API to deliver information about the Destination during the date selection. It would be helpful when coming up with search methods and writing if statements in functions to deliver data to the client. I also like the UI of their application, I might try to replicate it to some degree. Overall, I feel like this GitHub repo will be very helpful in the making of our app.
